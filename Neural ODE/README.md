## üìñ Introduction

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) are a powerful tool for modeling continuous-time dynamical systems. This project demonstrates how Neural ODEs can be utilized to predict the optimal rotation age for timber growth, focusing on maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV) from timber sales. By capturing the underlying dynamics of timber growth through time, this model provides valuable insights for forestry management and decision-making.

## üìâ Loss Function in Neural ODE for Timber Growth Prediction

The **loss function** plays a crucial role in training the Neural ODE model, quantifying the discrepancy between predicted and actual timber volumes. For this project, we employ the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function, which calculates the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. MSE is particularly suitable for regression tasks like timber growth prediction, as it heavily penalizes larger errors, prompting the model to minimize significant deviations.

During the training process, the Neural ODE model aims to minimize the MSE by adjusting its weights through backpropagation using the **Adam optimizer**. Observing the trend of the loss function over epochs provides insights into the model‚Äôs learning journey. A **decreasing loss** signifies improved predictions, while a **static or oscillating loss** may indicate convergence issues or hyperparameter tuning needs.

Below is the plot showing the loss function over the course of training:

## üèãÔ∏è Training Procedure of Neural ODE and Observed Patterns

Training a **Neural ODE for timber growth prediction** involves feeding sequential data into the model, adjusting its internal states, and updating weights via backpropagation. Throughout each epoch, the model processes batches of time windows to predict future growth based on historical data. The **Adam optimizer** facilitates effective learning by minimizing the loss function. Initially, predictions may seem erratic as the model struggles to grasp the underlying patterns.

As training continues, several patterns may be observed:
1. **Gradual Improvement**: Predictions begin to align more closely with actual growth values as the model learns.
2. **Overfitting**: The model may excel on the training set but falter on unseen data, indicating the need for regularization.
3. **Training Instability**: Fluctuations in predictions may occur during training, which could necessitate adjustments to learning rate or network architecture.
4. **Convergence**: The model achieves stable and accurate predictions, demonstrating effective learning and generalization from the data.

Below is a plot comparing the **predicted growth vs actual growth** over time, offering a visual representation of the model's performance:
